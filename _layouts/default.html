			<h1>ABOUT</h1>
			<p>
				I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at Stanford University. I am obsessed with Machine Learning
				and am involved in AI initiatives such as the Stanford AI Lab. I am interested in CS education and have
				headed many education initiatives, such as teaching workshops during my membership in BASES and leading
				the creation of an AI elective series through CS + Social Good. I am fascinated with Philosophy and enjoy
				reading metaphysics papers when I have some time. I can often be found working on code projects or
				bingeing House of Cards, FRIENDS, or How I Met Your Mother in my free time.

						<p>
							This past summer, I interned at Nasdaq as a part of the Machine Learning team. The team undertook two projects,

							set and assisted in developing a Recurrent Neural Network for prediction. The second was using trade history data to
							predict Nasdaq network latency. I spearheaded this initiative and  designed the overall architecture of the
							neural network that we will be developing. I was heavily involved in the network's development and training, and extended <thead>
						  the internship by two weeks as I took charge of the project handoff to Nasdaq.

							from the Blockchain to create decentralized resource-sharing initiatives. I was the "tech person" on the team,
							providing insight on technical feasibility and leading prototype development. We went through three design sprints,
							rapidly iterating by creating prototypes and gathering feedback. Our final three high-fidelity deliverables were

							During the summer of 2016, I was on the Research &amp; Development Team at State Farm Insurance. I was
							tasked with implementing a fully-trained neural network on an iPhone. I used an open-source execution engine
							called DeepLearningKit to accomplish this. The final app was able to classify images belonging to the CIFAR-10
							dataset and run the neural network on the iPhone's Metal GPU, in effect meaning that the user could download an entire
							neural network to their phone.<br>
							I was also the Dev Team Lead for the Summer Intern Website project. I was in charge of a team of 30 developers who all
							had differing proficiency levels with frontend development. Using Agile methodoligies such as sprints, stories, and a Kanban board,
							I was able to lead this diverse team to quickly and effeciently develop a beautiful internal website in just 8 weeks.

The project served as my final project for Stanford CS 231n, \“Convolutional Neural Networks\”, a class I took Freshman year. The network’s task was to be able to learn the style of many artworks and be able to transfer the style onto any target image. Imagine the functionality of the app \"Prisma\", but instead of being restricted to a few paintings, the user could input any painting they like! As of the start of the project, it first time that the specific architecture had ever been attempted on this task.<br><br>I was able to achieve modest success on the novel architecture. I went through many weeks of tuning hyperparameters for experimentation and was able to get proof that the architecture does work. I wrote about the experiments and success in my final research-grade paper for the class, which can be found in the \”Writings\” section of the website.",
